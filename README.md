# Antbook Project - The personal computer totally based on cloud streaming.
## Felipe Gonz√°lez Vilches - March. 2018.

The antbook project, as described in its abstract [file](https://github.com/fgvilches/antbook/blob/master/pj_ab_abs.pdf) consisted of designing a personal computer (accompanied by a subscription service) which was 100% based on cloud computing.



This project was developed during the first semester of 2018 by the Ant team, and although it did not reach more than a TRL 5 model and a paper (of which the abstract attached in this post is part and if you need it, feel free to write me an [email] (mailto: hola@fgvilches.info))
