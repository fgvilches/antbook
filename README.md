# Antbook Project - The personal computer totally based on cloud streaming.
## Felipe González Vilches - Developed on March. 2018.

The antbook project, as described in its abstract [file](https://github.com/fgvilches/antbook/blob/master/pj_ab_abs.pdf) consisted of designing a personal computer (accompanied by a subscription service) which was 100% based on cloud computing.

This project was developed during the first semester of 2018 by me and the Ant team, and although it did not reach more than a TRL 5 model and a paper (of which the abstract attached in this post is part and if you need it, feel free to write me an email) the idea is worth sharing, so I created the following post. 
## Please consider that everything that follows was written and developed in 2018.

## First of all... some background

Today there is no technology company that does not have a product, solution or service adapted to the cloud. It is the most modern and current and it seems that whoever is not in the cloud will have nothing to do in the technological world in the future.
As an example of the above we have the most used data clouds, What would happen to University students when sending notes without the transmission of WhatsApp files or Airdrop?
Or even more without the co-work options of Google Drive? 
It is probably impossible to conceive the same workflow that is seen today in universities without such tools.

But, why if the cloud is "as powerful" as seen on paper, we continue to carry heavy computers to have a decent computing power and graphics card?


- [ ] Is it not possible what is suggested above?
- [ ] Didn't we think about it?
- [ ] Or is there a real limitation?

This is how in March 2018 I got to work to analyze if similar systems worked 100% "Cloud Based", and I found surprises such as the Nvidia Shield capable of streaming a large library of console games with the power of a cell phone. Or Latin American platforms such as GLOUD which (although at 720p) managed to stream smooth games and worked with a similar subscription system.
But the one that caught my attention was Parsec (the one without a subscription system) offered to stream your computers, consoles and others without inputlag, over long distances and with a 10mbps connection.

So, all of the above led me to think that there was no real limitation for not carrying out a cloud-based laptop, so I started to investigate the internet connection (That was perhaps the limitation by which something like this does not currently exist) and I found that the average speeds for 4g in Chile (My country) were 17.36Mbps of download and 8.55Mbps upload (According to Speedtest.net based on the average speed of Claro Chile on its 4g Network in the Metropolitan Region) and fixed connection ISP's have an average download of 52Mbps and 10Mbps of upload (According to Speedtest.net based on the average speed of Vtr Chile in its Fiber Optic Network in the Metropolitan Region), in this way It seems difficult to imagine that the internet could be a limitation.

In the end we do not find technological limitations today (even more thinking about a world that is preparing to receive 5G in the coming years **)

## Sooooooooo The Idea...

First of all I have to clarify that this task is not new at all, it is something that has been carried out within offices for years through a thin client structure (with protocols like PCOIP or RDP) connected to a single server where all the applications and programs run.

![Alt text](Thin_clients.png?raw=true "Thin Clents Structure")

Wikipedia defines a Thin client as "lightweight computer that has been optimized for establishing a remote connection with a server-based computing environment. The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, performing calculations, and storing data"

Soooo the idea is to make a Personal computer based on a thin client  arq usign a motherboard with low computing power of type: Raspberry, Intel IoT Kit and/or similar, Amoled screen to reduce energy consumption, Lithium battery that generates an autonomy of about 3 hours (In that moment we knew it was little but we left it like that to keep the weight low).
On the connectivity side, must have Wifi, ethernet (Possibly similar to 3com's XJACK implementation), Bluetooth, GPS, 4G/5G (Depending on contact with operators).

## On the SaaS Side...
