# Antbook Project - The personal computer totally based on cloud streaming.
## Felipe González Vilches - Developed on March. 2018.

The antbook project, as described in its abstract [file](https://github.com/fgvilches/antbook/blob/master/pj_ab_abs.pdf) consisted of designing a personal computer (accompanied by a subscription service) which was 100% based on cloud computing.

This project was developed during the first semester of 2018 by the Ant team, and although it did not reach more than a TRL 5 model and a paper (of which the abstract attached in this post is part and if you need it, feel free to write me an email) the idea is worth sharing, so I created the following post.

## First of all... some background

Today there is no technology company that does not have a product, solution or service adapted to the cloud. It is the most modern and current and it seems that whoever is not in the cloud will have nothing to do in the technological world in the future.
As an example of the above we have the most used data clouds, What would happen to University students when sending notes without the transmission of WhatsApp files or Airdrop?
Or even more without the co-work options of Google Drive? 
It is probably impossible to conceive the same workflow that is seen today in universities without such tools.

But, why if the cloud is "as powerful" as seen on paper, we continue to carry heavy computers to have a decent computing power and graphics card?


- [] Is it not possible what is suggested above?
- [] Didn't we think about it?
- [] Or is there a real limitation?

This is how in March 2018 I got to work to analyze if similar systems worked 100% "Cloud Based", and I found surprises such as the Nvidia Shield capable of streaming a large library of console games with the power of a cell phone. Or Latin American platforms such as GLOUD which (although at 720p) managed to stream smooth games and worked with a similar subscription system.
But the one that caught my attention was Parsec (the one without a subscription system) offered to stream your computers, consoles and others without inputlag, over long distances and with a 10mbps connection.
